                    <h1>GROUND CONTROL: A JOURNEY THROUGH CHESS AND SPACE</h1>
                    <h5><i>November 7, 2019</i></h5>

                    <p>Organized in connection with the 50th anniversary of the
                        Apollo 11 moon landing on July 16, 1969, Ground Control:
                        A Journey Through Chess and Space showcases
                        out-of-this-world artifacts from the collection of the
                        World Chess Hall of
                        Fame (WCHOF) and lenders Duncan Pohl and Allan Savage.
                        Ground Control also examines important chess events from
                        1969 including Boris Spassky’s victory in the World
                        Chess Championship, Nona Gaprindashvili’s win in the
                        Women’s World
                        Chess Championship, important tournaments in the United
                        States and around the world as well as the births of
                        future world chess champion Viswanathan Anand and
                        trailblazer and future women’s world chess champion
                        Susan Polgar.</p>

                    <p>Just as the 1972 world chess championship match between
                        Bobby Fischer and Boris Spassky is often seen as an
                        embodiment of the Cold War tensions between the United
                        States and Soviet Union, in the space race, the two
                        nations competed
                        for superiority in the realms of science and technology.
                        They sought to achieve important firsts in space
                        exploration, such as putting the first satellite into
                        orbit, the first manned space flights, and putting a
                        person on the
                        moon. Some of the artifacts in Ground Control testify to
                        the excitement of these years—a chessboard featuring a
                        Soviet rocket blasting into space and artifacts related
                        to a game between the cosmonauts aboard Soyuz 9 (Andrian
                        Nikolayev
                        and Vitaly Sevastyanov) and cosmonaut Viktor Gorbatko
                        and general Nikolai P. Kamanin, who were on Earth.</p>

                    <p>Space also has a special connection to the history of the
                        WCHOF. One highlight of our collection, acquired after
                        the museum moved from Miami to Saint Louis, is the
                        chessboard flown as part of the official flight kit on
                        the last mission
                        of the Space Shuttle Endeavour (May 16-June 1, 2011).
                        Competitors in the 2010 U.S. and U.S. Women’s Chess
                        Championships, which were held at the Saint Louis Chess
                        Club, signed the board. Also, NASA astronaut Greg
                        Chamitoff was present
                        at the opening festivities of the World Chess Hall of
                        Fame, which coincided with the launch of the Boy Scouts
                        of America Chess Merit Badge (September 11, 2011). Dr.
                        Jeanne Sinquefield led the effort to establish the chess
                        merit
                        badge. Scouts reenacted a recent game between space and
                        Earth on a life-sized board before they received the
                        very first badges.</p>

                    <p>Chess is one of the world’s oldest games, but it is often
                        featured in visions of the future and the far reaches of
                        the galaxy. Mr. Spock played Tri-Dimensional Chess
                        against Captain James Kirk in Star Trek, which aired
                        from September
                        8, 1966, through June 3, 1969. The game continued to
                        appear in later Star Trek franchises. The WCHOF’s
                        collection, which numbers over 1000, includes sets
                        related to the game’s top players as well as ones with
                        pop culture themes
                        taken from television shows and movies set in space,
                        including The Jetsons, Star Wars, and Star Trek. Many of
                        these are included in Ground Control. We hope that you
                        will enjoy this exhibition, whether you’re a space
                        enthusiast,
                        a pop culture junkie, or a fan of history.</p>
