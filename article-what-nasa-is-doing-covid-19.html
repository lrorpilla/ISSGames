                    <p>Three astronauts are scheduled to launch to the
                        International Space Station (ISS) on April 9. They won’t
                        return to Earth for six months. Instead, they’ll watch
                        from the safety of outer space as a pandemic plays out
                        some 250 miles (400
                        kilometers) beneath their feet. </p>

                    <p>Escaping Earth for six months might sound like a dream to
                        most of humanity right now, but these spacefarers must
                        be vigilant to avoid bringing COVID-19 aboard the ISS
                        with them. The odds of that happening are low, but the
                        consequences
                        of an outbreak in orbit could have dire consequences.
                        Medical supplies are limited on the ISS, and an
                        emergency trip home could be both risky and tricky. So
                        to plan for the worst, American and Russian space
                        agencies have stepped
                        up their preventive measures ahead of the launch of
                        astronaut Chris Cassidy and cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin
                        and Ivan Vagner. </p>

                    <p>These three astronauts are not the only ones scheduled
                        for an upcoming launch, either. NASA is moving ahead
                        with another important crew mission as early as May. Two
                        more astronauts, Doug Hurley and Robert Behnken, will
                        fly to the ISS
                        aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule. If all goes well,
                        they’ll be the first humans to ride a private spacecraft
                        into orbit. According to a report by CBS News, Hurley
                        and Behnken are also already aggressively trying to
                        limit their
                        exposure to coronavirus.</p>

                    <p>Sending five humans into orbit is challenging enough
                        under normal circumstances. But it’s harder still during
                        a pandemic. Coronavirus concerns have already had an
                        impact on spaceflight and space science. Several
                        employees at NASA facilities
                        have tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, the
                        space agency has stepped up its response, implementing
                        additional cleaning and social distancing measures, as
                        well as requiring many employees to work from home.</p>

                    <p>What a game! Huge congratulations on your victory! I'm
                        truly proud of you, and inspired by your dedication,
                        focus, brilliance, and patience too! Also, a huge
                        congratulations to all of you who followed the game and
                        participated as part
                        of the “Earth Team,” by voting for the moves on-line.
                    </p>

                    <p>All of this has the space agency keeping an extra close
                        eye on its astronauts.</p>

                    <b>
                        <p>NASA takes action to avoid COVID-19</p>
                    </b>

                    <p>To stop diseases — including COVID-19 — from spreading in
                        space, NASA and its Russian counterpart, Roscosmos, keep
                        astronauts in quarantine for weeks before a flight. They
                        will also complete a detailed inspection and
                        disinfection of
                        cargo bags.</p>

                    <p>This quarantine process isn’t new, so astronauts are
                        accustomed to such precautions. A string of space colds
                        on early Apollo missions pushed NASA to start isolating
                        its astronauts before launch more than half a century
                        ago. (The Soviet
                        Union also kept its Mir space station cosmonauts in
                        quarantine ahead of launches.) Neil Armstrong, Buzz
                        Aldrin, and Michael Collins even lived in their Mobile
                        Quarantine Facility — a converted Airstream trailer —
                        for weeks after
                        Apollo 11 returned from the Moon. However, this
                        quarantine wasn’t as much about protecting the
                        astronauts as it was about NASA’s desire to avoid
                        bringing uninvited lunar microorganisms back to Earth.
                    </p>

                    <p>Those early traditions carried over to the ISS, and they
                        still help keep astronauts from getting sick in space
                        today.</p>
