                    <h1>Exploring the Stars Through Video and Board Games</h1>
                    <h5><i>November 13, 2017</i></h5>

                    <p>At first glance, video and board games may appear as nothing more than pastimes — for students to kill time in between assignments, for example. But in recent years NASA and many other organizations are recognizing games as a way to engage younger audiences.</p>

                    <p>The benefits of exposing students to topics in astronomy through games are numerous. Games are a technology, or a medium already familiar to youth; and through the right “game mechanisms” or game design, they can entice users into repeated play while promoting learning opportunities in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mechanics). The challenge, however, is making sure the academics don’t weigh down the gameplay and turn away the players.</p>

                    <p>“I think to engage kids you have to find that balance between complexity and science, and I think the ideal is to not make a game that’s overbearing in terms of its scope,” said Efka Bladukas, co-host of the British video blog (vlog) No Pun Included that focuses on board games.</p>

                    <p>Games are almost as old as civilization itself but in many ways haven’t changed much over the millennia: we still take turns, roll dice and read cards just like our ancestors did. It’s easy these days to find space board games — both “American style” (emphasizing the experience of play) and “European style” (emphasizing logic and strategy) — even in typical toy stores. There are board games for famous franchises, such as Star Trek and Battlestar: Galactica. And sometimes there are variations of games set in space, such as Settlers of Catan, a renowned European-style board game where players are settlers trading resources to survive.</p>

                    <p>Educational games, however, are somewhat more difficult to find, especially in the relatively new and specialized field of astrobiology. That said, there are examples. Through the NASA Astrobiology Institute (NAI), the NASA Astrobiology Program has supported the development of an educational game called Life Underground, where students play the role of a scientist investigating a subsurface environment to search for and characterize microbial life. The game is in now in the final stages of production, and the team behind Life Underground at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts recently put out a call for educator reviewers to test the software.</p>

                    <p>A second example is Astrobiotica, a Portuguese astrobiology game that has been used in a handful of secondary schools for the last 15 years. The board game teaches students about the field’s history, and has them use cards to support competing theories of life’s origin on Earth; that it was imported from space (exogenous model), or that it arose from non-living Earth biology (endogenous model).</p>

                    <p>The co-creator is biologist Francisco Carrapico at the University of Lisbon in Portugal, and Telma Rodrigues, an educator at Emidio Navarro Secondary School in nearby Almada, Portugal. The two have long-standing collaborations in education and biology and have aims to introduce astrobiology education across all Portuguese secondary schools.</p>

                    <p>“I love the theme of astrobiology because my students never heard about it,” Rodrigues said. “I try to say the word ‘astrobiology’ and they come up with some ideas about what it means — some of them wrong ideas — but it leads them to the real thing and the science.”</p>

                    <p>While students learn astrobiology they unwittingly pick up the skills needed to be a scientist, particularly teamwork, Carrapico added.</p>

                    <p>“I believe the cooperation can be used for other lab materials in class,” he said, noting that the students are also conducting experiments that simulate life’s origins.</p>
