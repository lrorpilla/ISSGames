                    <p>The first Earth vs. Space chess match, begun during
                        astronaut Greg Chamitoff’s Expedition 17 stay aboard the
                        International Space Station, is over – and the Earth
                        won.</p>

                    <p>NASA and the U.S. Chess Federation (USCF) teamed up to
                        host the match, which started in September 2008.
                        Chamitoff conceded the match in a Dec. 16, 2009, letter
                        to the third grade U.S. Chess Championship Team and its
                        chess club teammates
                        from Stevenson Elementary School in Bellevue, Wash. The
                        USCF facilitated the match, coordinating worldwide
                        voting on the Earth’s moves, which were proposed by the
                        K-3 champions. </p>

                    <p>Chamitoff, who continued the match via e-mail after his
                        183-day space mission and return to Earth on Nov. 30,
                        2008, is scheduled to fly again on the upcoming STS-134
                        mission of Space Shuttle Endeavour. He sent the
                        following letter
                        to the students: </p>

                    <i>
                        <p>Dear Stevenson Elementary Chess Team,</p>

                        <p>What a game! Huge congratulations on your victory!
                            I'm truly proud of you, and inspired by your
                            dedication, focus, brilliance, and patience too!
                            Also, a huge congratulations to all of you who
                            followed the game and participated as part of the
                            “Earth Team,” by voting for the moves on-line. </p>

                        <p>This was a fantastic game with so many intricate
                            twists and turns. When the time between moves is
                            measured in days, it seems that the depth of
                            analysis and strategy happens at a different level.
                            This made for a very exciting game! This wasn't the
                            longest game ever played, but for sure it set a
                            record for long distance!</p>

                        <p>I wish we could have played the entire game between
                            “Space” and “Earth” while I was still onboard the
                            International Space Station, but perhaps there will
                            be time for a complete “Earth vs Space” match one
                            day, when some of you are living on the Moon or
                            Mars. No doubt, that the game of chess will travel
                            with us to the stars. But more importantly, it's
                            terrific to see how the game of chess is inspiring
                            so many young minds to think and work in ways that
                            can prepare them for the roles they will play in
                            building our future. </p>

                        <p>It's been a great honor for me to play a small part
                            in that. Thanks to so many people from NASA, the
